# Lyft-Demand-for-Bike

Description: Lyft, Inc. is a transportation network company based in San Francisco, California and operating in 640 cities in the United States and 9 cities in Canada. It develops, markets, and operates the Lyft mobile app, offering car rides, scooters, and a bicycle-sharing system. It is the second largest rideshare company in the world, second to only Uber. Lyftâ€™s bike-sharing service is also among the largest in the USA. Being able to anticipate demand is extremely important for planning of bicycles, stations, and the personnel required to maintain these.
